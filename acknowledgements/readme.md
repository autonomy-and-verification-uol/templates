# Acknowledgements Templates

### September 2018

This is a repository of tex templates for acknowledgements sections.
One file per particular style. For example, one for ACM, one for LNCS, etc.

If adding a new template please include:
* publisher
* date you put the template together
* document class 
* information about how/where to use the template

I've populated the templates with the EPSRC Hubs grant sponsors and numbers.

This aims to be a quick, cut and paste/importable template to get the job done. The actual text in the acknowledgements is not standardised and may be changed.
